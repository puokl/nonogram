      <h1>Welcome to Nonogram!</h1>
      <p>
        Nonogram is a picture logic puzzle where you fill in cells to reveal the
        hidden picture. Here are the rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each puzzle consists of a grid with numbers along the top and left
          sides. These numbers provide clues for filling in the cells.
        </li>
        <li>
          The numbers indicate groups of filled cells in each row or column. For
          example, "3 2" means there are groups of three and two filled cells,
          separated by at least one empty cell.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your goal is to use the provided clues to determine which cells should
          be filled in to create an image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on cells to fill them. Use the toggle button to switch between
          cells to be selected (e.g., filled with color) and cells to be
          discarded (e.g., marked with an 'X').
        </li>
        <li>
          If an error is made, the filled cells will turn green. You have a
          limited number of errors allowed, so use them wisely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Complete the puzzle by filling in all the correct cells according to
          the clues, revealing the hidden picture!
        </li>
      </ul>
