      <p>
        Nonogram is a picture logic puzzle where you fill in cells to reveal the
        hidden picture. Here are the rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each puzzle consists of a grid with numbers along the top and left
          sides.
        </li>
        <li>
          The numbers indicate groups of filled cells in each row or column.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your goal is to use the provided clues to determine which cells should
          be filled in to create an image.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on cells to fill them, and use the toggle button to switch
          between black and red colors.
        </li>
        <li>
          If an error is made, the filled cells will turn green, and you have a
          limited number of errors allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Complete the puzzle by filling in all the correct cells and reveal the
          hidden picture!
        </li>
      </ul>
